Purpose: To randomly generate puzzles with a solution using c standard libraries and outputting to terminal. Current version is 0.8 because the last function, generateSolution, is currently not finished.
* NEW ADDITIONS *
* Finished the maze generator in entirety. While there are some more improvements to be done, it is in a usable state by this point
* Added feature to support a GUI using the GTK toolkit. It is very simple and limited by this point, but will display the text found in savePuzzles.txt
* Most likely final update to software
